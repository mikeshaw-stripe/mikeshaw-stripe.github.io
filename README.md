# What is this?
This repo is a [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) repo created by freezing a Python Flask Application into static content.

## Wha?
[Frozen Flask](https://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/)

Frozen Flask is a Flask extenstion which allows you to create static content from a Flask Application. 

As part of a Python Ireland Meetup talk I created a simple Flask Application showing an integration between Flask and Stripe Checkout. 

This was the output from running [freeze.py](https://github.com/mikeshaw-stripe/flask-checkout-demo/blob/master/freeze.py) located at [this](https://github.com/mikeshaw-stripe/flask-checkout-demo) repo.
